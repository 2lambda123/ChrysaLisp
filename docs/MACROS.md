# Macros

This document covers ChrysaLisp macros, what they are and what you can do with
them. What can be said about Lisp macros that has not allready been said ?

When I first started ChrysaLisp I had never used Lisp in anger, just observed
from the sidelines and thought "that's neat..." . One of the biggest features
of Lisp like languages was allways macros. Not the text substitution idea of
lesser languages, but the real deal.

So what is "the real deal..." ? Sounds like some Lisp guys just smack taking
other languages to me yeah ?

Well no actually ! It really is a big deal once you get into it. It's not just
that it can save you a lot of typing, which it can, but it allows you to create
your own syntax for your applications and things that I don't think I'm
qualified to talk about yet.

So let's start slow and work our way up to my level, basic Amoeba... the Lisp
Gurus are going to die laughing at my attempts to cover this subject...
